This app was created at the Feb 7th Hack Housing Hackathon in Seattle WA.

Challenge and Approach

Challenge: There is a massive shortage of housing options available for low income families. The fastest route to increasing housing supply may be through appealing to private landlord’s investment strategies. If adequate return on investment could be demonstrated to real estate investors (landlords); and a system could be provided to link qualified tenants with their properties the problem of housing shortages may be diminished.

Action: Provide map comparing Zillow’s sales/rent data to fair market value (FMV). Provide calculations based on FMV vs. purchase/rent data + estimated costs to bring property up to code, cost of inspections, financing costs, and/or any other program requirements to help determine potential return on investment.

Future upgrades: Pages should outline the Pros of joining the program, and it could link directly to housing authorities to help streamline paperwork submittal for program approval, have reminders for inspections, document storage for lease and tenant information and possibly a portal to communicate with tenants.

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

Research currently available low income programs in Seattle
Research currently available tax incentives for low income housing.
